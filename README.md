# app_dashboard
An web app where you can see data from a database according to the period of time you select. It was made using jQuery, HTML, Php, Css, JavaScript and MySQL. 

Jamilton Damasceno guided me with this project in his Udemy's course. The 'NÃºmero de Vendas' e 'Total Vendas' were created during the classes. The other data like 'Clientes Ativos' and "Total de elogios" I made as an activity to test my knowledges.
