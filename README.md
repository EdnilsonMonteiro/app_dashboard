# app_dashboard
An web app where you can see data from a database according to the period of time you select. It was made using jQuery, HTML, Php, Css, JavaScript and MySQL. 

Jamilton Damasceno guided me with this project in his Udemy's course. The 'Número de Vendas' e 'Total Vendas' were created during the classes. The other data like 'Clientes Ativos' and "Total de elogios" I made as an activity to test my knowledges.

# Run project
You will need to install Xamp and run Apache and MySQL modules. Also app_dashboard should be placed in htdocs inside xamp folder. Once you did these steps, you're ready to run the app. The final step is go to your browser and search: http://localhost/dashboard.
